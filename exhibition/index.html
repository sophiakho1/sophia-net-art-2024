    <h1>Love Online: Net Art about Love</h1>
    <p>Exhibition curated by Sophia Khodorkovsky</p>
</header>

<div class="curatorial-text">
    <p>The works in this exhibition will explore love and intimacy through the digital lens, reflecting on how the internet has reshaped human connections since the beginning of its development. 
        “LOVE”, from GROUP Z in 1995, used an early Internet browsing aesthetic as a means of interactive exploration of affection through text. 
        "My boyfriend came back from the war" by Olia Lialina from 1996 is representative of the emotional binds one could have with the early web aesthetic developments, showing the struggle of absence and reunion through digital space. 
        In “SKINONSKINONSKIN”, 1999, by ENTROPY8ZUPER! boundaries are broken between physical and digital love through imagery and text. These works together look at the intersection of relationships, technology, and narrative in a rapidly changing digital landscape and offer reflections on the evolution of desire and connection in the digital age.</p>

        <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Olia Lialina</p>
        <img src="img/war.png" alt="My boyfriend came back from the war by Olia Lialina">
        <p>This piece captures the emotional complexity of long-distance love and the impact of separation due to war. 
            Through a web page structure that simulates the emotional experience of waiting and reunion, Lialina uses the internet's 
            early aesthetic to underscore the distance between lovers and the rawness of digital communication in the face of longing and reunion.</p>
