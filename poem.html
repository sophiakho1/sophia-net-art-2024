   <h1><strong> She Walks in Beauty</h1></strong>

    <p>She walks in beauty, like the night<br>
    Of cloudless climes and starry skies;<br>
    And all that’s best of dark and bright<br>
    Meet in her aspect and her eyes;<br>
    Thus mellowed to that tender light<br>
    Which heaven to gaudy day denies.</p>

    <p>One shade the more, one ray the less,<br>
    Had half impaired the nameless grace<br>
    Which waves in every raven tress,<br>
    Or softly lightens o’er her face;<br>
    Where thoughts serenely sweet express,<br>
    How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.</p>

    <p>And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,<br>
    So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,<br>
    The smiles that win, the tints that glow,<br>
    But tell of days in goodness spent,<br>
    A mind at peace with all below,<br>
    A heart whose love is innocent!</p>
